# Profile Classifier Tool - Project Structure

## Overview
Successfully refactored from a monolithic 450+ line main.py into a clean, modular architecture.

## File Structure

### Core Modules

**config_manager.py** (38 lines)
- `ConfigManager` class
- Handles JSON config loading/saving
- Provides get/set methods for configuration
- Creates default config if none exists

**model.py** (96 lines)  
- `ProfileModel` class
- ResNet18 model initialization and management
- Model loading/saving functionality
- Image preprocessing and inference
- Device management (CPU/GPU)

**screenshot.py** (124 lines)
- `ScreenshotManager` class  
- Screenshot capture from configured regions
- Image saving with timestamps
- CSV labeling functionality
- Automation loop logic
- Label statistics and validation

**gui.py** (303 lines)
- `GUI` class
- Complete DearPyGui interface
- Button callbacks and event handling
- Configuration panel with live updates
- Screenshot display and texture management
- Threading for automation

**main.py** (19 lines)
- Simple entry point
- Just imports and launches GUI
- Clean and minimal

## Benefits of Refactoring

✅ **Maintainability**: Each file has a single responsibility
✅ **Testability**: Components can be tested independently  
✅ **Reusability**: Modules can be imported into other projects
✅ **Debugging**: Issues are isolated to specific modules
✅ **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features without touching other code

## Dependencies

Each module only imports what it needs:
- `config_manager.py`: json, os
- `model.py`: torch, torchvision, os
- `screenshot.py`: pyautogui, PIL, pandas, time, datetime, os
- `gui.py`: dearpygui, threading, numpy + local modules
- `main.py`: gui module only

## Working Features

✅ GUI launches successfully
✅ Configuration management
✅ Model initialization (ResNet18)
✅ All button callbacks implemented
✅ Screenshot display system
✅ Modular architecture with clean imports

## Next Steps

- Add training implementation
- Implement overlay system 
- Add more robust error handling
- Create unit tests for each module
- Add logging system

The refactoring was successful - from one large file to 5 focused, maintainable modules!
